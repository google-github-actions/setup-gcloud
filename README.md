# `setup-gcloud` GitHub Action

Configures the [Google Cloud SDK][sdk] in the GitHub Actions environment. The Google Cloud SDK includes both the [gcloud][gcloud] and
[gsutil][gsutil] binaries.

Or integrate natively with other Google Cloud GitHub Actions:

* [Authenticate to Google Cloud][auth]
* [Deploy a Cloud Run service](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun)
* [Deploy an App Engine app](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-appengine)
* [Deploy a Cloud Function](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions)
* [Access Secret Manager secrets](https://github.com/google-github-actions/get-secretmanager-secrets)
* [Upload to Cloud Storage](https://github.com/google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage)
* [Configure GKE credentials](https://github.com/google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials)

## üì¢ NOTICES

-   **Do not pin this action to `@master`, use `@v0` instead. We are going to
    rename the branch to `main` in 2022 and this _will break_ existing
    workflows. See [Versioning](#versioning) for more information.**

-   **Previously this repository contained the code for ALL of the GCP GitHub
    Actions. Now each action has it's own repo and this repo is only for
    `setup-gcloud`.**

    For `setup-gcloud`:

    ```diff
    steps:
    - id: gcloud
    -  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
    +  uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0
    ```

    For other actions (example uses `deploy-cloudrun`):

    ```diff
    steps:
    - id: deploy
    -  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
    +  uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v0
    ```

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

## Inputs

### Cloud SDK inputs

-   `version`: (Optional) A string representing the version of the Cloud SDK
    (`gcloud`) to install (e.g. `"290.0.1"`). The default value is "latest",
    which will install the latest available Cloud SDK version.

-   `project_id`: (Optional) Project ID (**not** project _number_) of the Google
    Cloud project. If provided, this will configure the `gcloud` CLI to use that
    project ID for commands. Individual commands can still override the project
    with the `--project` flag. If unspecified, the action attempts to find the
    "best" project ID by looking at other inputs and environment variables.

### Authentication inputs

**‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated**: The following authentication inputs are deprecated and will
be removed in a future release. See [Authorization](#authorization) for more
information.

-   `service_account_key`: (**Deprecated**, optional) The Google Cloud service
    account key JSON. This key should be created and stored as a GitHub secret.
    It can be the raw JSON contents or a base64-encoded string of the raw JSON
    contents. There is no default value.

-   `service_account_email`: (**Deprecated**, optional) Email address of the
    service account to use for authentication. This is only required for p12
    service account keys, which are no longer recommended. This input is not
    required if using a JSON service account key. There is no default value.

-   `export_default_credentials`: (**Deprecated**, optional) If true, the action
    will write credentials to the filesystem and export the
    `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable for future steps to
    consume [Application Default Credentials][adc]. The default value is false.

-   `credentials_file_path`: (**Deprecated**, optional) The path at which the
    exported credentials should be written on disk. In order for the credentials
    to be available for future steps, it must be in `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` or
    `$RUNNER_TEMP`. This is only valid when `export_default_credentials` is
    true. The default value is a temporary file inside `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.

-   `cleanup_credentials`: (**Deprecated**, optional) If true, the action will
    remove any generated credentials from the filesystem after all steps have
    completed. This only applies if `export_default_credentials` is true. The
    default value is true.


## Example workflows

* [Google Kubernetes Engine](./example-workflows/gke/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to an existing [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) cluster.

* [Cloud Run](./example-workflows/cloud-run/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy a container to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/).

* [Google Compute Engine](./example-workflows/gce/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to deploy a container to an existing [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute-engine/) (GCE) instance.

* [App Engine](./example-workflows/gae/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to deploy source
code to [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine), a fully managed serverless platform.

* [Cloud Build](./example-workflows/cloud-build/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to build a container image with [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build).


## Authorization

This action installs the Cloud SDK (`gcloud`). To configure its authentication
to Google Cloud, use the [google-github-actions/auth][auth] action. You can
authenticate via:

### Workload Identity Federation (preferred)

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Service Account Key JSON

```yaml
job:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Application Default Credentials

If and only if you are using self-hosted runners that are hosted on Google Cloud Platform,
the Cloud SDK will automatically authenticate using the machine credentials:

```yaml
job:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```


## Versioning

We recommend pinning to the latest available major version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'
```

While this action attempts to follow semantic versioning, but we're ultimately
human and sometimes make mistakes. To prevent accidental breaking changes, you
can also pin to a specific version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0.1.1'
```

However, you will not get automatic security updates or new features without
explicitly updating your version number. Note that we only publish `MAJOR` and
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions. There is **not** a floating alias for
`MAJOR.MINOR`.
