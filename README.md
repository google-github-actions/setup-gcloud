# `setup-gcloud` GitHub Action

Configures the [Google Cloud SDK][sdk] in the GitHub Actions environment. The Google Cloud SDK includes both the [gcloud][gcloud] and
[gsutil][gsutil] binaries.

Or integrate natively with other Google Cloud GitHub Actions:

* [Authenticate to Google Cloud](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth)
* [Deploy a Cloud Run service](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun)
* [Deploy an App Engine app](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-appengine)
* [Deploy a Cloud Function](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions)
* [Access Secret Manager secrets](https://github.com/google-github-actions/get-secretmanager-secrets)
* [Upload to Cloud Storage](https://github.com/google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage)
* [Configure GKE credentials](https://github.com/google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials)

## ðŸ“¢ NOTICES

-   **Do not pin this action to `@master`, use `@v0` instead. We are going to
    rename the branch to `main` in 2022 and this _will break_ existing
    workflows. See [Versioning](#versioning) for more information.**

-   **Previously this repository contained the code for ALL of the GCP GithHub
    Actions. Now each action has it's own repo and this repo is only for
    `setup-gcloud`.**

    For `setup-gcloud`:

    ```diff
    steps:
    - id: gcloud
    -  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
    +  uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0
    ```

    For other actions (example uses `deploy-cloudrun`):

    ```diff
    steps:
    - id: deploy
    -  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
    +  uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v0
    ```

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

## Inputs

| Name          | Requirement | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `version`     | _optional_  | `latest`| The version of the `gcloud` to be installed. Example: `290.0.1`|
| `project_id`  | _optional_  | | ID of the Google Cloud Platform project. If provided, this will configure `gcloud` to use this project ID by default for commands. Individual commands can still override the project using the `--project` flag which takes precedence. |
| `service_account_email` | _optional_  | | Service account email address to use for authentication. This is required for legacy .p12 keys but can be omitted for JSON keys. This is usually of the format `<name>@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. |
| `export_default_credentials`| _optional_  |`false`| Exports the path to [Default Application Credentials][dac] as the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to be available in later steps. Google Cloud services automatically use this environment variable to find credentials. |
| `credentials_file_path`     | _optional_  | (temporary file) | Only valid when `export_default_credentials` is `true`. Sets the path at which the credentials should be written. |
| `cleanup_credentials` | _optional_ | `true` | If true, the action will remove any generated credentials from the filesystem upon completion. |
| `service_account_key`   | _optional_  | | (**Deprecated**) This input is deprecated. See [auth section](https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud#authorization) for more details. The service account key which will be used for authentication credentials. This key should be [created](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and stored as a [secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). It can be encoded as a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) string or as JSON. |


## Example Workflows

* [Google Kubernetes Engine](./example-workflows/gke/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to an existing [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) cluster.

* [Cloud Run](./example-workflows/cloud-run/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy a container to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/).

* [Google Compute Engine](./example-workflows/gce/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to deploy a container to an existing [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute-engine/) (GCE) instance.

* [App Engine](./example-workflows/gae/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to deploy source
code to [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine), a fully managed serverless platform.

* [Cloud Build](./example-workflows/cloud-build/README.md): An example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to build a container image with [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build).


## Authorization

This action installs the Cloud SDK (`gcloud`). To configure its authentication to Google Cloud, use the [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) action. You can authenticate via:

### Workload Identity Federation (preferred)

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Service Account Key JSON

```yaml
job:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0'
      with:
        credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Application Default Credentials

If and only if you are using self-hosted runners that are hosted on Google Cloud Platform,
the Cloud SDK will automatically authenticate using the machine credentials:

```yaml
job:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```


## Versioning

We recommend pinning to the latest available major version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0'
```

While this action attempts to follow semantic versioning, but we're ultimately
human and sometimes make mistakes. To prevent accidental breaking changes, you
can also pin to a specific version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0.1.1'
```

However, you will not get automatic security updates or new features without
explicitly updating your version number. Note that we only publish `MAJOR` and
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions. There is **not** a floating alias for
`MAJOR.MINOR`.
