# `setup-gcloud` GitHub Action

Configures the [Google Cloud SDK][sdk] in the GitHub Actions environment. The Google Cloud SDK includes both the [gcloud][gcloud] and
[gsutil][gsutil] binaries.

Or integrate natively with other Google Cloud GitHub Actions:

* [Authenticate to Google Cloud][auth]
* [Deploy a Cloud Run service](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun)
* [Deploy an App Engine app](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-appengine)
* [Deploy a Cloud Function](https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions)
* [Access Secret Manager secrets](https://github.com/google-github-actions/get-secretmanager-secrets)
* [Upload to Cloud Storage](https://github.com/google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage)
* [Configure GKE credentials](https://github.com/google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials)

## Prerequisites

-   This action requires Google Cloud credentials to execute gcloud commands.
    See [Authorization](#Authorization) for more details.

-   This action runs using Node 20. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
    runners, you must use a [runner
    version](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) that supports this
    version or newer.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
      with:
        version: '>= 363.0.0'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

## Inputs

### Cloud SDK inputs

-   `skip_install`: (Optional) Skip the `gcloud` installation and use the
    [system-installed gcloud][github-runners] instead. This can dramatically
    improve workflow speeds at the expense of a slightly older gcloud version.
    Setting this to `true` ignores any value for the `version` input. If you
    skip installation, you will be unable to install components because the
    system-install gcloud is locked. The default value is `false`. ⚠️ Be aware
    that GitHub [plans to remove](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/7101)
    the system-installed gcloud, and any workflows with `skip_install: true`
    will stop working when that happens.

-   `version`: (Optional) A string representing the version or version
    constraint of the Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) to install (e.g. `"290.0.1"` or `">=
    197.0.1"`). The default value is `"latest"`, which will always download and
    install the latest available Cloud SDK version.

    ```yaml
    - uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
      with:
        version: '>= 416.0.0'
    ```

    If there is no installed `gcloud` version that matches the given constraint,
    this GitHub Action will download and install the latest available version
    that still matches the constraint.

    **Warning!** Workload Identity Federation requires version
    [363.0.0](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/release-notes#36300_2021-11-02)
    or newer. If you need support for Workload Identity Federation, specify your
    version constraint as such:

    ```yaml
    - uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
      with:
        version: '>= 363.0.0'
    ```

    You are responsible for ensuring the `gcloud` version matches the features
    and components required. See the [gcloud release
    notes][gcloud-release-notes] for a full list of versions.

-   `project_id`: (Optional) Project ID (**not** project _number_) of the Google
    Cloud project. If provided, this will configure the `gcloud` CLI to use that
    project ID for commands. Individual commands can still override the project
    with the `--project` flag. If unspecified, the action attempts to find the
    "best" project ID by looking at other inputs and environment variables.

-   `install_components`: (Optional) List of [Cloud SDK
    components](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components) to install
    specified as a comma-separated list of strings:

    ```yaml
    install_components: 'alpha,cloud-datastore-emulator'
    ```

## Authorization

This action installs the Cloud SDK (`gcloud`). To configure its authentication
to Google Cloud, use the [google-github-actions/auth][auth] action. You can
authenticate via:

### Workload Identity Federation (preferred)

**⚠️ You must use the Cloud SDK version 390.0.0 or later to authenticate the
`bq` and `gsutil` tools.**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Service Account Key JSON

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
      with:
        credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}'

    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Application Default Credentials

If and only if you are using self-hosted runners that are hosted on Google Cloud Platform,
the Cloud SDK will automatically authenticate using the machine credentials:

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    steps:
    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'

    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
```

### Multiple Service Accounts

To use multiple service accounts, a second auth step is required to update the credentials before using `setup-gcloud`:

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # Add "id-token" with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
      - id: 'auth service account 1'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
          service_account: 'service-account-1@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

      - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'

      - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
        run: 'gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE --format="value(account)"'
        # service-account-1@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

      - id: 'auth service account 2'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
        with:
          credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}'

      - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'

      - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
        run: 'gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE --format="value(account)"'
        # service-account-2@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```


## Versioning

We recommend pinning to the latest available major version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
```

While this action attempts to follow semantic versioning, but we're ultimately
human and sometimes make mistakes. To prevent accidental breaking changes, you
can also pin to a specific version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2.0.0'
```

However, you will not get automatic security updates or new features without
explicitly updating your version number. Note that we only publish `MAJOR` and
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions. There is **not** a floating alias for
`MAJOR.MINOR`.
