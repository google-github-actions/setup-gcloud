name: Set up gcloud Cloud SDK environment
author: Google LLC
description: |-
  Downloads, installs, and configures a Google Cloud SDK environment.
  Adds the `gcloud` CLI command to the $PATH.

inputs:
  version:
    description: |-
      A string representing the version or version constraint of the Cloud SDK
      (`gcloud`) to install (e.g. `"290.0.1"` or `">= 197.0.1"`). The default
      value is `"latest"`, which will always download and install the latest
      available Cloud SDK version.

          - uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
            with:
              version: '>= 416.0.0'

      If there is no installed `gcloud` version that matches the given
      constraint, this GitHub Action will download and install the latest
      available version that still matches the constraint.

      Authenticating via Workload Identity Federation requires version
      [363.0.0](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/release-notes#36300_2021-11-02)
      or newer. If you need support for Workload Identity Federation, specify
      your version constraint as such:

          - uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
            with:
              version: '>= 363.0.0'

      You are responsible for ensuring the `gcloud` version matches the features
      and components required.
    default: 'latest'
    required: false

  project_id:
    description: |-
      ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this will configure gcloud to
      use this project ID by default for commands. Individual commands can still
      override the project using the `--project` flag which takes precedence. If
      unspecified, the action attempts to find the "best" project ID by looking
      at other inputs and environment variables.
    required: false

  install_components:
    description: |-
      List of additional [gcloud
      components](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components) to install,
      specified as a comma-separated list of strings:

          install_components: 'alpha,cloud-datastore-emulator'
    required: false

  skip_install:
    description: |-
      Skip installation of gcloud and use the [system-supplied
      version](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) instead. If specified,
      the `version` input is ignored.

      ⚠️ You will not be able to install additional gcloud components, because the
      system installation is locked.
    default: false
    required: false

outputs:
  version:
    description: |-
      Version of gcloud that was installed.
