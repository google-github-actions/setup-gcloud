name: Set up gcloud Cloud SDK environment
author: Google LLC
description: |-
  Downloads, installs, and configures a Google Cloud SDK environment.
  Adds the `gcloud` CLI command to the $PATH.

inputs:
  version:
    description: |-
      A string representing the version or version constraint of the Cloud SDK
      (`gcloud`) to install (e.g. `"290.0.1"` or `">= 197.0.1"`). The default
      value is `"latest"`, which will always download and install the latest
      available Cloud SDK version.

          - uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
            with:
              version: '>= 416.0.0'

      If there is no installed `gcloud` version that matches the given
      constraint, this GitHub Action will download and install the latest
      available version that still matches the constraint.

      Authenticating via Workload Identity Federation requires version
      [363.0.0](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/release-notes#36300_2021-11-02)
      or newer. If you need support for Workload Identity Federation, specify
      your version constraint as such:

          - uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'
            with:
              version: '>= 363.0.0'

      You are responsible for ensuring the `gcloud` version matches the features
      and components required.
    default: 'latest'
    required: false

  project_id:
    description: |-
      ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this will configure gcloud to
      use this project ID by default for commands. Individual commands can still
      override the project using the `--project` flag which takes precedence. If
      unspecified, the action attempts to find the "best" project ID by looking
      at other inputs and environment variables.
    required: false

  workload_identity_provider:
    description: |-
      The full identifier of the Workload Identity Provider, including the
      project number, pool name, and provider name. If provided, this must be
      the full identifier which includes all parts, for example:
      "projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider".
      This is mutually exclusive with "credentials_json".
    required: false

  service_account:
    description: |-
      Email address or unique identifier of the Google Cloud service account for
      which to generate credentials. This is required if
      "workload_identity_provider" is specified.
    required: false

  credentials_json:
    description: |-
      The Google Cloud JSON service account key to use for authentication. This
      is mutually exclusive with "workload_identity_provider".
    required: false

  install_components:
    description: |-
      List of additional [gcloud
      components](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components) to install,
      specified as a comma-separated list of strings:

          install_components: 'alpha,cloud-datastore-emulator'
    required: false

  skip_install:
    description: |-
      Skip installation of gcloud and use the [system-supplied
      version](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) instead. If specified,
      the `version` input is ignored.

      ⚠️ You will not be able to install additional gcloud components, because the
      system installation is locked.
    default: false
    required: false

outputs:
  version:
