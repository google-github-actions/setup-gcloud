## **ðŸ“¢ DEPRECATION NOTICE**

### **GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/appengine-deploy has been deprecated. Please use google-github-actions/deploy-appengine**

```diff
steps:
 - id: deploy
-  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/appengine-deploy@master
+  uses: google-github-actions/deploy-appengine@main
```

This action deploys your source code to [App Engine][gae] and makes the URL
available to later build steps via outputs. This allows you to parameterize your
App Engine deployments.

**Note:** This action will install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) in the
background if not using in with the [`setup-gcloud` action](../setup-gcloud/README.md).

## Prerequisites

This action requires Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to deploy an
App Engine Application. See the Authorization section below for more information.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
- id: deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/appengine-deploy@master
  with:
    credentials: ${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}

# Example of using the output
- id: test
  run: curl "${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}"
```

## Inputs

- `project_id`: (Optional) ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this
  will override the project configured by gcloud.

- `deliverables`: (Optional) The [yaml files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/configuration-files#optional_configuration_files)
  for the services or configurations you want to deploy. If not given, defaults
  to app.yaml in the current directory. If that is not found, attempts to
  automatically generate necessary configuration files (such as app.yaml) in
  the current directory (example, `app.yaml cron.yaml`).

- `image_url`: (Optional) Deploy with a specific container image. The image url
  must be from one of the valid GCR hostnames (example, `gcr.io/`).

- `version`: (Optional) The version of the app that will be created or replaced
  by this deployment. If you do not specify a version, one will be generated for
  you.

- `promote`: (Optional) Promote the deployed version to receive all traffic.

### app.yaml customizations

Other application configurations can be customized through the app.yaml, ie the
service name. See [app.yaml Configuration File](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/config/appref)
for more information.

## Outputs

- `url`: The URL of your App Engine Application.

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. The caller must have
permissions to access the secrets being requested.

Roles needed:

- Storage Admin (`roles/compute.storageAdmin`): to upload files
- Cloud Build Editor (`cloudbuild.builds.editor`): to build the application
- App Engine roles:
  - Deployer (`roles/appengine.deployer`): Can deploy but can not promote
  - Admin (`roles/appengine.appAdmin`): Can manage all App Engine resources (not recommended)

*Note:* An owner will be needed to create the App Engine application

### Used with setup-gcloud

You can provide credentials using the [setup-gcloud][setup-gcloud] action,
however you must provide your Project ID to the `appengine-deploy` action:

```yaml
- uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
  with:
    version: '290.0.1'
    service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    export_default_credentials: true
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/appengine-deploy@master
  with:
    project_id: ${{ secrets.project_id }}
```

### Via Credentials

You can provide [Google Cloud Service Account JSON][sa] directly to the action
by specifying the `credentials` input. First, create a [GitHub
Secret][gh-secret] that contains the JSON content, then import it into the
action:

```yaml
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/appengine-deploy@master
  with:
    credentials: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/appengine-deploy@master
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
