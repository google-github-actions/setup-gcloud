## **ðŸ“¢ DEPRECATION NOTICE**

### **GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions has been deprecated. Please use google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions**

```diff
steps:
 - id: deploy
-  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions@master
+  uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions@main
```

This action deploys your function source code to [Cloud Functions](cloud-functions) and makes the URL
available to later build steps via outputs.

## Prerequisites

This action requires:

- Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to deploy a
Cloud Function. See the Authorization section below for more information.

- [Enable the Cloud Functions API](http://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudfunctions.googleapis.com?_ga=2.267842766.1374248275.1591025444-475066991.1589991158)

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
- id: deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions@master
  with:
    name: my-function
    runtime: nodejs10
    credentials: ${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}

# Example of using the output
- id: test
  run: curl "${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}"
```

## Inputs

- `name`: (Required) Name of the Cloud Function.

- `runtime`: (Required) Runtime to use for the function. Possible options documented [here][runtimes].

- `entry_point`: (Optional) Name of a function (as defined in source code) that will be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified. 

- `region`: (Optional) Region in which the function should be deployed. Defaults to `us-central1`.

- `credentials`: (Optional) Service account key to use for authentication. This should be
  the JSON formatted private key which can be exported from the Cloud Console. The
  value can be raw or base64-encoded. Required if not using a the
  `setup-gcloud` action with exported credentials.

- `env_vars`: (Optional) List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables in the format:
  KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2. All existing environment variables will be
  removed first.

- `source_dir`: (Optional) Source directory for the function. Defaults to current directory.

- `project_id`: (Optional) ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this
  will override the project configured by gcloud.

- `description`: (Optional) Description for the Cloud Function.

- `vpc_connector`: (Optional) The VPC Access connector that the function can connect to..

- `service_account_email`: (Optional) The email address of the IAM service account associated with the function at runtime.

- `timeout`: (Optional) The function execution timeout in seconds. Defaults to 60.

- `max_instances`: (Optional) The maximum number of instances for the function.

- `event_trigger_type`: (Optional) Specifies which action should trigger the function. Defaults to creation of http trigger.

- `event_trigger_resource`: (Optional) Specifies which resource from eventTrigger is observed.

- `event_trigger_service`: (Optional) The hostname of the service that should be observed.

## Allow unauthenticated requests

A Cloud Functions product recommendation is that CI/CD systems not set or change
settings for allowing unauthenticated invocations. New deployments are
automatically private services, while deploying a revision of a public
(unauthenticated) service will preserve the IAM setting of public
(unauthenticated). For more information, see [Controlling access on an individual service](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/managing-access-iam).

## Outputs

- `url`: The URL of your Cloud Function. Only available with HTTP Trigger.

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. A service account will be needed
with the following roles:

- Cloud Functions Admin (`cloudfunctions.admin`):
  - Can create, update, and delete functions.
  - Can set IAM policies and view source code.

This service account needs to a member of the `Compute Engine default service account`,
`(PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com)`, with role
`Service Account User`. To grant a user permissions for a service account, use
one of the methods found in [Configuring Ownership and access to a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_user_for_a_service_account).

### Used with `setup-gcloud`

You can provide credentials using the [setup-gcloud][setup-gcloud] action:

```yaml
- uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
  with:
    service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    export_default_credentials: true
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions@master
  with:
    name: my-function
    runtime: nodejs10
```

### Via Credentials

You can provide [Google Cloud Service Account JSON][sa] directly to the action
by specifying the `credentials` input. First, create a [GitHub
Secret][gh-secret] that contains the JSON content, then import it into the
action:

```yaml
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions@master
  with:
    credentials: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    name: my-function
    runtime: nodejs10
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions@master
  with:
    name: my-function
    runtime: nodejs10
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
