## **ðŸ“¢ DEPRECATION NOTICE**

### **GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun has been deprecated. Please use google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun**

```diff
steps:
 - id: deploy
-  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
+  uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@main
```

This action deploys your container image to [Cloud Run][cloud-run] and makes the URL
available to later build steps via outputs.

## Prerequisites

This action requires:

- Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to deploy a
Cloud Run service. See the Authorization section below for more information.

- [Enable the Cloud Run API](http://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/run.googleapis.com?_ga=2.267842766.1374248275.1591025444-475066991.1589991158)

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
- id: deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
  with:
    image: gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
    service: hello-cloud-run
    credentials: ${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}

# Example of using the output
- id: test
  run: curl "${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}"
```

## Inputs

- `image`: Name of the container image to deploy (e.g. gcr.io/cloudrun/hello:latest).
  Required if not using a service YAML.

- `service`: ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service.
  Required if not using a service YAML.

- `region`: Region in which the resource can be found.

- `credentials`: Service account key to use for authentication. This should be
  the JSON formatted private key which can be exported from the Cloud Console. The
  value can be raw or base64-encoded. Required if not using a the
  `setup-gcloud` action with exported credentials.

- `env_vars`: List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables in the format:
  KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2. **All existing environment variables will be retained**.

- `metadata`: YAML serivce description for the Cloud Run service. See
  [Metadata customizations](#metadata-customizations) for more information. 
  **Existing configuration will be retained besides container entrypoint and arguments**.

- `project_id`: (Optional) ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this
  will override the project configured by gcloud.

### Metadata customizations

You can store your service specification in a YAML file. This will allow for
further service configuration, such as [memory limits](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/memory-limits),
[CPU allocation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/cpu),
[max instances](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/max-instances),
and [more.](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy#OPTIONAL-FLAGS)

- See [Deploying a new service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#yaml)
to create a new YAML service definition, for example:

```YAML
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: SERVICE
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: IMAGE
```

- See [Deploy a new revision of an existing service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#yaml_1)
to generated a YAML service specification from an existing service:

```
gcloud run services describe SERVICE --format yaml > service.yaml
```
## Allow unauthenticated requests

A Cloud Run product recommendation is that CI/CD systems not set or change
settings for allowing unauthenticated invocations. New deployments are
automatically private services, while deploying a revision of a public
(unauthenticated) service will preserve the IAM setting of public
(unauthenticated). For more information, see [Controlling access on an individual service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access).

## Outputs

- `url`: The URL of your Cloud Run service.

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. A service account will be needed
with the following roles:

- Cloud Run Admin (`roles/run.admin`):
  - Can create, update, and delete services.
  - Can get and set IAM policies.

This service account needs to a member of the `Compute Engine default service account`,
`(PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com)`, with role
`Service Account User`. To grant a user permissions for a service account, use
one of the methods found in [Configuring Ownership and access to a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_user_for_a_service_account).

### Used with `setup-gcloud`

You can provide credentials using the [setup-gcloud][setup-gcloud] action:

```yaml
- uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
  with:
    version: '290.0.1'
    service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    export_default_credentials: true
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
  with:
    image: gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
    service: hello-cloud-run
```

### Via Credentials

You can provide [Google Cloud Service Account JSON][sa] directly to the action
by specifying the `credentials` input. First, create a [GitHub
Secret][gh-secret] that contains the JSON content, then import it into the
action:

```yaml
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
  with:
    credentials: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    image: gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
    service: hello-cloud-run
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
- id: Deploy
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@master
  with:
    image: gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
    service: hello-cloud-run
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
