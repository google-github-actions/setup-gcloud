# Cloud Build - GitHub Actions

An example workflow that uses [GitHub Actions][actions] to build a
[Hello World Node.js app](index.js) container image using [Cloud Build][cloud-build].

This code is intended to be an _example_. You will likely need to change or
update values to match your setup.

## Workflow description

For pushes to the `master` branch, this workflow will:

1.  Download and configure the Google [Cloud SDK][sdk] with the provided
    credentials.

1.  Build, tag, and push a container image to Google Container Registry.

    - The image is built using Cloud Build and pushed to Google Container Registry.

    - The image is available through the following tags: `latest` and first 8 of
      the commit SHA.

## Setup

1.  Create a new Google Cloud Project (or select an existing project) and
    [enable the Cloud Build and Cloud Build APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com,run.googleapis.com).

1.  Create or reuse a GitHub repository for the example workflow:

    1.  [Create a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

    1.  Move into the repository directory:

        ```
        $ cd <repo>
        ```

    1.  Copy the example into the repository:

        ```
        $ cp -r <path_to>/github-actions/example-workflows/cloud-build/ .
        ```

1.  [Create a Google Cloud service account][create-sa] if one does not already
    exist.

1.  Add the the following [Cloud IAM roles][roles] to your service account:

    - [`Cloud Build Service Account`](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/cloud-build-service-account) - allows for execution of builds on your behalf

    - `Viewer` - allows for Cloud Build log storage

1.  [Create a JSON service account key][create-key] for the service account.

1.  Add the following secrets to your repository's secrets:

    - `RUN_PROJECT`: Google Cloud project ID

    - `RUN_SA_EMAIL`: the email of the service account

    - `RUN_SA_KEY`: the content of the service account JSON file

## Run the workflow

1.  Add and commit your changes:

    ```text
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Set up GitHub workflow"
    ```
