## **ðŸ“¢ DEPRECATION NOTICE**

### **GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/get-gke-credentials has been deprecated. Please use google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials**

```diff
steps:
 - id: get-credentials
-  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/get-gke-credentials@master
+  uses: google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@main
```

This action configures authentication to a [GKE cluster][gke] via a `kubeconfig` file that can be used with `kubectl` or other methods of interacting with the cluster.

Authentication is performed by generating a [short-lived token][token] (default behaviour) or via the [GCP auth plugin][gcp-auth-plugin] present in `kubectl` which uses the service account keyfile path in [GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS][gcp-gcloud-auth].

## Prerequisites

This action requires:

- Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to view a GKE cluster. See the Authorization section below for more information.

- [Create a GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart?_ga=2.267842766.1374248275.1591025444-475066991.1589991158)

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
- id: get-credentials
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/get-gke-credentials@master
  with:
    cluster_name: my-cluster
    location: us-central1-a
    credentials: ${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}

# The KUBECONFIG env var is automatically exported and picked up by kubectl.
- id: get-pods
  run: kubectl get pods
```

## Inputs

- `cluster_name`: (Required) Name of the cluster to get credentials for.

- `location`: (Required) Location (Region/Zone) for the cluster.

- `credentials`: (Optional) Service account key to use for authentication. This should be
  the JSON formatted private key which can be exported from the Cloud Console. The
  value can be raw or base64-encoded. Required if not using a the
  `setup-gcloud` action with exported credentials.

- `project_id`: (Optional) Project ID where the cluster is deployed. If provided, this
  will override the project configured by gcloud.

- `use_auth_provider`: (Optional) Flag to use GCP auth plugin in kubectl instead of a short lived token. Defaults to false.

- `use_internal_ip`: (Optional) Flag to use the internal IP address of the cluster endpoint with private clusters. Defaults to false.

## Outputs

- Exports env var `KUBECONFIG` which is set to the generated `kubeconfig` file path.

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. A service account will be needed
with **at least** the following roles:

- Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer (`roles/container.clusterViewer`):
  - Get and list access to GKE Clusters.
`

### Via Credentials

You can provide [Google Cloud Service Account JSON][sa] directly to the action
by specifying the `credentials` input. First, create a [GitHub
Secret][gh-secret] that contains the JSON content, then import it into the
action:

```yaml
- id: get-credentials
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/get-gke-credentials@master
  with:
    cluster_name: my-cluster
    location: us-central1-a
    credentials: ${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
- id: get-credentials
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/get-gke-credentials@master
  with:
    cluster_name: my-cluster
    location: us-central1-a
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
