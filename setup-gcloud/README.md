# setup-gcloud

## **ðŸ“¢ DEPRECATION NOTICE**

### **GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud has been deprecated. Please use google-github-actions/setup-gcloud**

```diff
steps:
 - id: gcloud
-  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
+  uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
```

This action configures the [Google Cloud SDK][sdk] in the environment for use in
actions. The Google Cloud SDK includes both the [gcloud][gcloud] and
[gsutil][gsutil] binaries.

It does the following:

1.  Downloads a version of the [Google Cloud SDK][sdk] according to the
    specified `version` input, as well as the environment OS and architecture.

1.  Installs and caches the downloaded version into the actions environment.

1.  If `project_id` is specified, gcloud will use this project ID as the default
    project ID for all future invocations. You can override this on a
    per-invocation basis using the `--project` flag.

1.  If `service_account_key` is specified, authenticates the gcloud CLI tool
    using the service account key. For legacy .p12 keys, you must also specify a
    `service_account_email`.

1.  If `export_default_credentials` is specified, exports the path to the
    credentials in the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to
    be available in later steps. Google Cloud technologies automatically use
    this environment variable to find credentials.

    **IMPORTANT!** Exporting default credentials requires `actions/checkout@v2`.
    The `v1` tag is not supported and will not work.

    **WARNING!** This persists the application credentials inside the workspace. If
    you are building packages or artifacts, be sure to exclude the credentials!

## Prerequisites

* This action requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.9 or later to be installed on the environment.

* A pre-configured GCP service account. [More info](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

* `actions/checkout@v2` if using `export_default_credentials`.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
  with:
    version: '290.0.1'
    project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
    service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    export_default_credentials: true
- run: gcloud info
```

## Inputs

* `version`: (Optional) The version of the gcloud to be installed.  Example: `290.0.1`, Default: `latest`

* `service_account_email`: (Optional) Service account email address to use for authentication. This is required for legacy .p12 keys but can be omitted for .json keys. This is usually of the format `<name>@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

* `service_account_key`: (Optional) The service account key which will be used for authentication. This key should be [created](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and stored as a [secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). It can be encoded as a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) string (eg. `cat my-key.json | base64` on macOS) or as JSON.

* `export_default_credentials`: (Optional) Export the provided credentials as [Google Default Application Credentials][dac]. This will make the credentials available to later steps. Future steps that consume Default Application Credentials will automatically detect and use these credentials.

* `credentials_file_path`: (Optional) Only valid when `export_default_credentials` is `true`. Sets the path at which the credentials should be written. If not provided, `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is used.

* `project_id`: (Optional) ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this will configure gcloud to use this project ID by default for commands. Individual commands can still override the project using the --project flag which takes precedence.
