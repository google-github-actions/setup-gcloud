# upload-cloud-storage

## **ðŸ“¢ DEPRECATION NOTICE**

### **GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage has been deprecated. Please use google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage**

```diff
steps:
 - id: upload-file
-  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
+  uses: google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@main
```

This action uploads files/folders to a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)][gcs] bucket. This is useful when
you want upload build artifacts from your workflow.

Paths to files that are successfully uploaded are set as output variables and can be
used in subsequent steps.

## Prerequisites

- This action requires Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to upload
  blobs to the specified bucket. See the Authorization section below for more
  information.

## Usage

### For uploading a file

```yaml
steps:
  - id: upload-file
    uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
    with:
      path: /path/to/file
      destination: bucket-name/file

  # Example of using the output
  - id: uploaded-files
    uses: foo/bar@master
    env:
      file: ${{steps.upload-file.outputs.uploaded}}
```

The file will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/file`

### For uploading a folder

```yaml
steps:
  - id: upload-files
    uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
    with:
      path: /path/to/folder
      destination: bucket-name

  # Example of using the output
  - id: uploaded-files
    uses: foo/bar@master
    env:
      files: ${{steps.upload-files.outputs.uploaded}}
```

If the folder has the following structure:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ folder
    â”œâ”€â”€ file1
    â””â”€â”€ folder2
        â””â”€â”€ file2
```

The files will be uploaded to `gs://bucket-name/folder/file1`,`gs://bucket-name/folder/folder2/file2`

## Inputs

- `path`: (Required) The path to a file or folder inside the action's filesystem
  that should be uploaded to the bucket.

  You can specify either the absolute path or the relative path from the action:

  ```yaml
  path: /path/to/file
  ```

  ```yaml
  path: ../path/to/file
  ```

- `destination`: (Required) The destination for the file/folder in the form bucket-name or with
  an optional prefix in the form bucket-name/prefix

  ```yaml
  destination: bucket-name
  ```

  In the above example, the file will be uploaded to gs://bucket-name/file

  ```yaml
  destination: bucket-name/prefix
  ```

  In the above example, the file will be uploaded to gs://bucket-name/prefix/file

- `credentials`: (Optional) [Google Service Account JSON][sa] credentials as JSON or base64 encoded string,
  typically sourced from a [GitHub Secret][gh-secret]. If unspecified, other
  authentication methods are attempted. See [Authorization](#Authorization) below.

## Outputs

List of successfully uploaded file(s).

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: upload-file
    uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
    with:
      path: /path/to/file
      destination: bucket-name/file
```

will be available in future steps as the output "uploaded":

```yaml
- id: publish
  uses: foo/bar@master
  env:
    file: ${{steps.upload-file.outputs.uploaded}}
```

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. The caller must have
permissions to access the secrets being requested.

### Via the setup-gcloud action

You can provide credentials using the [setup-gcloud][setup-gcloud] action:

```yaml
- uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
  with:
    service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
    export_default_credentials: true
- uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
```

The advantage of this approach is that it authenticates all future actions. A
disadvantage of this approach is that downloading and installing gcloud may be
heavy for some use cases.

### Via credentials

You can provide [Google Cloud Service Account JSON][sa] directly to the action
by specifying the `credentials` input. First, create a [GitHub
Secret][gh-secret] that contains the JSON content, then import it into the
action:

```yaml
- id: upload-file
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
  with:
    credentials: ${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}
    path: /path/to/folder
    destination: bucket-name/file
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
- id: upload-file
  uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@master
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.
